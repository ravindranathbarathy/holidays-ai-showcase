# n8n Holidays AI Showcase

## Overview

This is a showcase of automation workflows I built using **n8n**, a powerful open-source workflow automation platform. This documentation covers the key workflows and demonstrations, along with insights into self-hosted automation, AI model integration, and learning resources.

## 📖 About n8n

### What Makes n8n Special?

n8n is an open-source, fair-code workflow automation platform that stands out because:

## 🧠 Integrating AI Models with n8n

One of the most powerful aspects of n8n is its ability to integrate with cutting-edge AI models. Here's how they work together:

### Supported AI Platforms

**OpenAI Integration**
- GPT-4 and GPT-4o for advanced reasoning
- Vision models for image analysis
- Embedding models for semantic search

**Anthropic Claude**
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for long-context processing
- Strong reasoning and analysis capabilities
- Constitutional AI for safety

**Google Gemini**
- Multimodal capabilities (text, image, audio)
- Competitive pricing and performance
- Excellent integration with Google services

**Open Source Models**
- Llama 2/3 for self-hosted deployment
- Mistral for efficient inference
- HuggingFace for custom models

### Real-World Workflow Examples

1. **Content Generation Pipeline** - Receive requests → Generate content with GPT-4 → Format and save
2. **Document Intelligence** - Upload PDFs → Extract text → Analyze with Claude → Send summary
3. **Customer Support Automation** - Receive tickets → Classify with AI → Draft responses → Send for approval
4. **Data Analysis** - Collect data → Process with AI → Generate insights → Create reports
5. **Multi-Step Reasoning** - Complex task → Break down with AI → Execute steps → Aggregate results
