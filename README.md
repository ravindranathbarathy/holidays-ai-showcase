# n8n Holidays AI Showcase

Welcome to my n8n automation showcase! This repository documents a 15-minute demonstration of workflows I've built with **n8n**, a powerful self-hosted workflow automation platform enhanced with AI capabilities.

## 🤖 What is n8n?

**n8n** is an open-source, fair-code workflow automation platform that allows you to:

- **Connect 400+ applications and services** without coding expertise
- **Build complex automation workflows** with a visual interface
- **Self-host on your own infrastructure** for complete data privacy and control
- **Integrate with leading AI models** for intelligent automation
- **Create conditional logic, loops, and error handling** for robust workflows
- **Run locally or in the cloud** with full flexibility

Unlike cloud-only solutions, n8n gives you complete ownership of your data and workflows, making it ideal for sensitive operations and custom requirements.

## 📂 Project Structure

  - `assets/images/` - Images and graphics
  - `assets/screenshots/` - Workflow screenshots
- **`workflows/`** - Exported n8n workflow files

## 🚀 Quick Start

To learn more about what I've built, check out the [full documentation](docs/index.md).

## ⚙️ Setup

This showcase uses n8n locally hosted on a mini PC. To run these workflows, you'll need:

- n8n installed locally ([Installation Guide](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/))
- Required integrations/credentials as documented in each workflow
- API keys for any AI models or external services used
